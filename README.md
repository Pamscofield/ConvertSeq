## Initiation

I need to convert DNA / RNA sequence quite frequently, sometimes for designing primers or for other purposes. Every time I have to google " DNA reverse complement" and click, click, click which annoys me very much. So I asked chatGPT if it could write scripts for me (given that I have no experience of this). This work is mainly done by chatGPT with the help of me :)

## Installation

1. download the zip file, unfold the zip into a folder
2. chrome - manage extension - developer mode (on) - load unpacked - choose the folder
